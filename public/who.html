<h2>Who is Ferry?</h2>
<p>My name is Ferry Utomo. You might wonder the origin of my surname. 
While it might sounds like Japanese, it is not. I was born on Java, so 
practically I'm a Javanese rather than a Japanese.
</p>
<p>I was born in the seventies and start programming when I was 14 years.
I write code fluently in the good old Delphi ðŸ¤¬, C# and JavaScript. 
Since the corona attack I trade my time I used to have to commute, two times 60km,
by learning Dart/Flutter to create Android/iOS apps.
