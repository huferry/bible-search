<h2>Why Did I Build This Demo?</h2>
<p>This demo demonstrates the use of Redux in React. Redux is a state management 
    that can be used in React project. I find React to be an easy framework to use. 
    Its learning curve is not to steep, but it can get very... very... advanced (thanks to the power
    of open source 💪🏽). Nonetheless in every advantage there always be a disadvantage (Johan Cruyf),
    while it's easy to create components in React, the states can go wild. Redux tame these wild
    states by managing them in one single storage.
</p>
<p>The demo might be simple but it suffies to excercise simple states to more 
    complex asynchronous states using Thunk. I really enjoyed creating this demo.
    I learnt a lot and I hope you can also take away something from it.
